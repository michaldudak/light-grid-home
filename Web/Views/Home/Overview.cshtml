<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
	Light Grid is a simple, lightweight grid build for Angular JS. Currently it supports both client-side and server-side operations.
	Its architecture allows to author extensions with ease.
</p>
<p>Take a look at the @Html.ActionLink("demos", "Demos", "Home") to see it in action.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
	<li>custom cell templates</li>
	<li>paging</li>
	<li>sorting</li>
	<li>search</li>
	<li>expandable details</li>
	<li>dynamic column visibility</li>
	<li>inline data edit</li>
</ul>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<p>
	Light Grid was created with a simple principle in mind - a grid should just display data (in various formats).
	Fetching objects from a remote server, paging, sorting, etc. should not be performed by a grid itself. That's why data providers were introduced.
	Their job is to prepare data for the grid to display. This makes the code cleaner, and development is more fun.
</p>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>
	The current version of Light Grid has been tested with Angular versions 1.4 to 1.6. However it should also work with older versions of the framework.
